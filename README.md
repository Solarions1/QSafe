## What is QSafe looking for?

In QSafe we seek to protect the user and its customers against cyber attacks such as:

- Phishing
- MitM
- DOS
- Ransomware
- Pharming
- Rootkits

Currently this project will take some time, but little by little it will be updated, the front-end code is free to use, the backend code is private due to the complications that our company would have for the mitigation service, if you want to participate in the project please contact the developer.
